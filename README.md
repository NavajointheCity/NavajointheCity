- 👋 Hi, I’m Davina from Denver
- 👀 I’m always interested in learning something new, so this year I decided to go for coding bootcamp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning another language and am pretty excited thinking about where I will be in 6 months.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of web and apps to help my people, the Navajo tribe. 
- 📫 How to reach me I can be reached via email.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am Navajo. I read, write, and speak my language.
